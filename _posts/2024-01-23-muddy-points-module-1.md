I hear you folks. This stuff can be __very__ confusing. So, here is hopefully some helpful supplemental material. This will not be an adequate substitute for our textbook or lectures, but more a complementary good [we'll get more to this topic at a later point :)]. 

## Key Definitions: ##
#### Comparative advantage  
    - CORE's definition: "A person or country has comparative advantage in the production of a particular good, if the cost of producing an addition unit of the good relative to the cost of producing another good is lower than another person or country's cost to produce the same two goods" 
#### Absolute advantage
    - CORE's definition: "A person or country has absolute advantage in the production of a good if the inputs it uses to produce this good are less than in some other person or country"
#### Specialization 
    - CORE's definition: "Specialization takes plan when a country or some other entity produces a more narrow range of goods and services than it consumes, acquiring the goods and services it does not produce by trade" 
#### Opportunity cost 
    - CORE's definition: "When taking an action implies forgoing the next best alternative action, the opportunity cost is the net benefit of the forgone alternative"

## Relating the Concepts: ##

## My Trusty 3 Step System + Example Problems ## 
    1. Solve for absolute advantage(s) first --> write them down 
    2. Look for the comparative advantages --> write them down 
    3. Analyze the comparative advantage calculations in a new table 

    BONUS STEP: When in doubt, relate back to what you know 
        - What are you and your bestie good at/less good at? 
        - Real life examples (real countries, friends, athletes, etc.)

#### Our Motivating Example: A Tale of Two Study Groups

Two best friends, Artha (A) and Bianca (B) are deciding how to get all their finals review work done given their busy, busy schedules. 
    
Since finals week (and life, frankly) is all about scarcity, they decide to divide and conquer (or __specialize__) to maximize their efficiency and grades! 

They both have unique strengths (or __comparative advantages__) for Spanish and Finance as described in the table below: 

|          | Spanish Paper | Finance Presentation |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Artha |      95      |      80     |
| Bianca |     80      |      95     |

 The table can be read such that if Artha spends all of her available time working on their Spanish paper, the girls' expected final grade in Spanish is a 95% (top left cell) and so on. 


|          | Spanish Paper | Finance Presentation |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Artha |      1.19x       |      0.84x       |
| Bianca |      0.84x      |      1.19x       |

###### Step 3 for Artha and Bianca: Read the Comparative Advantage Caclulations Table 
    - We read these tables from LEFT to RIGHT. Let's start with Artha
    - Artha: Can earn 1.19x the points towards their Spanish paper as Bianca, and earns .84x the points towards Finance as Bianca
    - Bianca: Earns .84x the points towards Spanish as Artha and 1.19x the points towards Finance as Artha 






Compare this however to a different study group in the same courses, Cyril (C) and Demir (D), who have the following advantage table: 

|          | Spanish Paper | Finance Presentation |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Cyril |      90    |      95   |
| Demir |      85    |      80   |


|          | Spanish Paper | Finance Presentation |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Cyril |      1.06x    |      1.19x   |
| Demir |      0.94x    |      0.84x   |

###### Step 3 for Cyril and Demir: Read the Comparative Advantage Caclulations Table  
    - If Cyril just focuses his efforts on their Finance presentation, his opportunity cost is the points on the Spanish paper he can earn for the team with the same amount of time he spends on Finance. 
        - In this case, For every unit of time he spend on the finance presentation, he earns them 1.19x the points towards their grade vs. 1.06x the points towards their Spanish grade. 
        - 1.19 > 1.06 so Cyril works on Spanish
    - If Demir focuses just on Spanish: he earns .94x the points towards their grade vs the .84x the points towards their finance grade per unit of time. 
        - .94 > .84 so Demir works on Spanish
